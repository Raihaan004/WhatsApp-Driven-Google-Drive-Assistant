### üöÄ Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

#### **1. Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed and configured:
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* A [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) account
* A [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/) account
* An [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) account with API access

#### **2. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

#### **3. Configure Your Environment**

This project uses credentials stored within n8n. You will need to gather the following keys and IDs from the respective services:

* **Twilio:** Account SID & Auth Token.
* **Google Cloud:**
    * OAuth Client ID & Client Secret for Google Drive & Google Sheets APIs.
    * The Spreadsheet ID for your logging sheet.
* **OpenAI:** Your OpenAI API Key.

#### **4. Run with Docker**

First, ensure no other container is using the name `n8n`. If you have an old one, remove it:
```bash
docker stop n8n && docker rm n8n
```
Then, start the project using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This will start n8n in the background. You can access the canvas at `http://localhost:5678`.

#### **5. Configure Services & Workflow**

1.  **Twilio Sandbox:**
    * Activate the Twilio Sandbox for WhatsApp and link your phone number.
    * In your n8n canvas, copy the **Production Webhook URL**.
    * Paste this URL into the "WHEN A MESSAGE COMES IN" field in your Twilio Sandbox settings.

2.  **Google Credentials:**
    * In the Google Cloud Console, enable the **Google Drive API** and **Google Sheets API**.
    * Create **OAuth 2.0 Credentials**. When asked for the "Authorized redirect URI," copy the one provided from within the n8n Google credential creation screen.

3.  **Google Sheet for Logging:**
    * Create a new Google Sheet.
    * In the first row, create the headers: `Timestamp`, `User`, `Command`, `Path`, `Argument`.
    * Copy the **Spreadsheet ID** from the sheet's URL.

4.  **n8n Workflow Setup:**
    * Import the `workflow.json` file provided in this repository into your n8n canvas.
    * The workflow will show credential errors. Click on each of the following nodes and create/select the appropriate credential:
        * **Twilio Node:** Connect your Twilio credential.
        * **Google Drive Nodes:** Connect your Google Drive OAuth2 credential.
        * **Google Sheets Node:** Connect your Google Sheets credential and paste your Spreadsheet ID.
        * **OpenAI Agent Node ("Message an assistant"):** Connect your OpenAI credential. *Note: You may need to run the `Create an assistant` action once separately to get an Assistant ID to use here.*
    * Activate the workflow using the toggle switch.
